## Description

Take a Break MT5 FREE is an Expert Advisor (EA) that helps protect trading accounts by pausing other EAs under certain conditions. It provides the option to pause EAs during news events, high volatility, low equity, and specific times.

### Input Parameters

- `pauseOnNews` (default: true): Enable/disable pausing EAs during news events.
- `pauseOnVolatility` (default: true): Enable/disable pausing EAs during high volatility.
- `pauseOnLowEquity` (default: true): Enable/disable pausing EAs when account equity is low.
- `pauseOnSpecificTime` (default: true): Enable/disable pausing EAs during specific times.
- `specificTime` (default: '12:00-13:00'): Specific time range to pause EAs.

### Global Variables

- `isPaused`: Flag to track if EAs are currently paused.

## Expert Advisor Logic

The EA's main function, `OnTick()`, is called on each tick of the trading instrument. It checks if the EAs should be paused using the `ShouldPauseEAs()` function. If pausing is required, it calls the `PauseEAs()` function to pause the EAs. If the EAs are already paused and the conditions for pausing are no longer met, it calls the `ResumeEAs()` function to resume the EAs. The remaining EA logic can be implemented after this check.

## Pause Conditions

The `ShouldPauseEAs()` function is responsible for checking the conditions to determine if the EAs should be paused. It checks the following conditions:

1. Pause on news: If enabled and a news event is happening, the EAs will be paused.
2. Pause on volatility: If enabled and the volatility is high, the EAs will be paused.
3. Pause on low equity: If enabled and the account equity is low, the EAs will be paused.
4. Pause on specific time: If enabled and the current time is within the specified time range, the EAs will be paused.

## Pausing and Resuming EAs

The `PauseEAs()` function is called when the EAs need to be paused. It can contain the necessary code to pause the EAs. Similarly, the `ResumeEAs()` function is called when the EAs need to be resumed. It can contain the necessary code to resume the EAs.

## Placeholder Functions

The code includes placeholder functions for checking specific conditions. These functions need to be implemented with the desired logic to determine the respective conditions.

- `IsNewsEvent()`: Placeholder function to check if a news event is happening.
- `IsHighVolatility()`: Placeholder function to check if the volatility is high.
- `IsLowEquity()`: Placeholder function to check if the account equity is low.
- `IsSpecificTime()`: Placeholder function to check if the current time is within the specified range.
